      <h1>Do Not Sell or Share My Personal Information</h1>
      <p className="updated">Last Updated: 02 May 2026</p>

      <p>This page is provided pursuant to the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (&ldquo;CCPA&rdquo;), as amended by the California Privacy Rights Act of 2020 (&ldquo;CPRA&rdquo;), and other applicable privacy laws that provide individuals with the right to opt out of the sale or sharing of their personal information.</p>
      <p>Sidiora is committed to respecting the privacy rights of all users, including California residents. This page describes how you can exercise your right to opt out.</p>

      <Section title="What Does 'Sell' or 'Share' Mean?">
        <p>Under the CCPA/CPRA, &ldquo;sell&rdquo; means disclosing personal information to a third party for monetary or other valuable consideration. &ldquo;Share&rdquo; means disclosing personal information to a third party for cross-context behavioural advertising purposes, whether or not for monetary consideration.</p>
        <p>We do not currently sell your personal information to third parties for monetary consideration. However, certain data practices — such as the use of analytics and advertising cookies — may qualify as &ldquo;sharing&rdquo; personal information under the CCPA/CPRA. This page gives you the ability to opt out of such practices.</p>
      </Section>

      <Section title="Your Rights">
        <p>If you are a California resident (or a resident of another state with similar opt-out rights), you have the right to:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Opt out of the sale or sharing of your personal information</strong> with third parties for cross-context behavioural advertising or other purposes as defined by applicable law;</li>
          <li><strong>Know</strong> what categories of personal information we collect, use, disclose, and share;</li>
          <li><strong>Delete</strong> personal information we have collected about you, subject to certain exceptions;</li>
          <li><strong>Correct</strong> inaccurate personal information we hold about you;</li>
          <li><strong>Non-discrimination</strong> — we will not discriminate against you for exercising any of your CCPA/CPRA rights.</li>
        </ul>
      </Section>

      <Section title="How to Opt Out">
        <p>To opt out of the sale or sharing of your personal information, or to exercise any of the other rights described above, please contact us through one of the following methods:</p>

      <Section title="Blockchain Data">
        <p>Please note that certain data associated with your use of the Sidiora Platform may be recorded on public blockchains. This on-chain data (such as wallet addresses and transaction history) is inherently public and immutable. We are not able to delete or modify on-chain records, and this data does not fall within the scope of your CCPA/CPRA opt-out rights as it is not data that we &ldquo;sell&rdquo; or &ldquo;share&rdquo; — it is broadcast to a public network by the nature of blockchain technology.</p>
